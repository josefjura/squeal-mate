# SquealMate

![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/josefjura/squeal-mate?include_prereleases)

## Purpose
Squeal Mate is designed to streamline the management of incremental SQL migration scripts. It allows developers to easily track available scripts, monitor execution history, and review execution outcomes. While it may not be universally essential, it is a powerful tool for developers managing databases with incremental migration scripts.

## Installation
Squeal Mate is a native build application with no prerequisites. Currently, there is no installer available, so download the binary and add it to your PATH. Alternatively, if you have the Rust toolchain installed, you can use the `cargo install` command. After installation, run `squealmate init` to create a permanent configuration file, eliminating the need to specify it with every command.
